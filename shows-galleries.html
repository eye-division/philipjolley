<h3>Philip Jolley &amp; Rose Wallace</h3>
<p>North Wall Gallery, South Parade, Oxford, OX2 7JN</p>

<p>in association with Oxfordshire Art Weeks</p>
<p>Wednesday 24th April to Friday 24th May 2013</p>
<p>Monday - Friday 10am - 4pm, Sat 12pm - 4pm, Sun 10pm-4pm</p>

<p>Craft Potters&rsquo; Association Members, Philip Jolley and Rose Wallace unite to explore &lsquo;The Past&rsquo; as a notion. This theme is deeply embedded in the core of their ceramic practice; however, both express distinctly different methods in inspiration, creation and outcome. This selling exhibition highlights the similarities and contrasts in their approach.</p>
<h4>Philip Jolley</h4>
<p>Recent pieces have evolved from the use of layers and colour and he is still very much interested in hidden detail and surface quality. For Philip, the suggestion of what might have once been and archaeological finds and remains, with their contrast in materials and surfaces, is most interesting.<br />
&ldquo;The pieces are meant to be touched, their tactile quality and surface contrasts are an integral part of the final intention.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Rose Wallace<br />
</h4>
<p>Rose is based at Magdalen Road Studios, her work references traditional Staffordshire mantelpiece ornaments; these unique ceramic figures are crafted from casts of contemporary packaging and discarded domestic ephemera. &ldquo;Quietly narrative, they capture the minutiae of modern life.&rdquo;</p>
